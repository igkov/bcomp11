# bcomp11 - on-board computer

Car on-board computer based on LPC11C14. Specified for Mitsubishi Pajero Sport 2nd gen.

Configurations
-----------------------------------------

The Keil MDK project have some configurations:

<b>bcomp11 (Debug)</b> - debug build.<br>
<b>bcomp11 Pajero (Release)</b> - release build for Mitsubishi Pajero.<br>
<b>bcomp11 Nissan (Release)</b> - release build with experimental Nissan functions.<br>
<b>bcomp11 Virtuino (Release)</b> - release build with Virtuino functionality.<br>

More information here: https://github.com/igkov/bcomp11/wiki/Firmware-structure.

For build in GCC-ARM use Makefile. GCC build didn't full functionality, because GCC generate more code. 

The sub-folder /pc contains HAL-level and build-script for compilation in MinGW-Win32. This build use for easy interface debug.

Compilation
---------

Use <a href="http://www.keil.com">Keil MDK</a> or <a href="https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads">GCC ARM</a>. Recommended version of Keil MDK - 4.24, newer versions have other editor kernel and cann't show Cyrillic in CP-1251 (only in Unicode/UTF-8), thats problem for show/edit Cyrillic text constants. Also Keil MDK 5+ have not problems with Cyrillic in CP-1251.

Program MCU
---------

For program MCU, please use USB-UART converter with DTR/RST control and programming utility as <a href="http://www.flashmagictool.com/">Flash Magic</a> or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpc21isp/">lpc21isp</a>.
